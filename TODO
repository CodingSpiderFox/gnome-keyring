decide on whether to allow attribute collisions or not
 probably yes, do we want a create_or_set call then?

keyring acls?

double fork in main

keep track of denied_keyrings in ask to avoid asking multiple times

make ask UI nicer

verify acls work
 
missing ops:
 delete keyring
 set keyring info
 set item info
 set item attributes
