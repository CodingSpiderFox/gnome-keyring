# Settings which control which PKCS#11 modules are used to lookup trust
# assertions like anchor certificate authorities, or pinned certificates.
#
# These are PKCS#11 URI's and are described here:
# http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri-03
#
# Do not change the settings here. Put your changes or overrides in
# a file called "pkcs11-options.conf" in the same directory.
